## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an [RFPs](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Grants-Program/tree/main/rfp-proposal), please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Polymesh grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Project Name: Fractio
- Fractio aims to create a democratized, fractionalized real estate investment platform. By leveraging the ERC1400 standard on blockchain, Fractio facilitates fractional ownership of real estate, enabling retail investors to access previously unreachable assets with a fraction of the cost, while maintaining compliance with global regulatory frameworks.

- Fractio integrates with Polymesh by utilizing its security token standards to ensure transparency, compliance, and efficiency in real estate transactions.
- The team is passionate about bridging the gap between retail investors and high-barrier real estate markets, using blockchain technology to revolutionize access to property investment globally.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

Fractio is a platform that uses blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets, specifically real estate, providing opportunities for fractional ownership. By offering these assets to retail investors, Fractio lowers the barrier to entry in property investments.

## Development Status :open_book:

Fractio will leverage the Polymesh Capital platform as the core infrastructure for tokenization services, offering a streamlined approach to fractional ownership of real estate assets. The Fractio team will focus on developing external APIs and additional platform features, working closely with Polymesh to ensure seamless integration.

The main service will focus on tokenizing real estate assets and facilitating a private marketplace for verified and accredited investors. Investors can purchase tokens to either fund property developments or receive a share of the revenue generated by the properties.

While Fractio has not yet tokenized real estate assets, our founder has experience in tokenizing personal assets. And has been bootsrtapping a Proof of concept platform for the past 9 months.

The most recent update can be seet here: # https://fractiodao.netlify.app/

The next steps include launching the MVP using the Polymesh platform, followed by the development of features to enhance investor experience, such as real-time property valuation and dynamic receipt Dnft's.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Recommendation by previous course I attended (Gritnova Global Campus).

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- As the founder, I have already experimented with tokenizing real world assets, utilizing the concept to tokenize my own personal assets to garner greater clarity around the requirements for the process.
- Founder: I have also continued to improve my knowledge and experience in the blockchain space by primarily focusing on blockchain development, while establishing partnerships with relevant and key partners in both the real-estate and blockchain space. This is an ongoing initiative.
